# Who
## Hi there! `Who` is here to help!

Want to keep up with your friends on campus and see who's in or not in class at any time? Who is built to keep students in touch in and out of classes. It stores and keeps track of people's class schedules and lets others check who is or is not in class at any given time. 

## It works like this

* To get started, download your schedule as a .ics file. For UBC students, do this by accessing your timetable from your SSC and downloading as ical (.ics) file.
* Next, upload the .ics file and type `?update` to update your calendar in Who's system.

Once a calendar is uploaded, anyone in the server can see who's free at any given time by using the command `?free` or simply by asking `whos free`. Add on a time by asking `whos free 12:00` to see your friends' availability at 12!

There are tons of other commands, such as `?busy` which lets you toggle if you want to be shown as free or if you're busy, and `?events` to show your or other people's events! [Add the bot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=900540913053499472&permissions=8&scope=bot) and type `?help` to see a comprehensive list of commands!

## Get started with Who

If you want to add Who to your server, [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=900540913053499472&permissions=8&scope=bot) and invite it! If you have any questions or concerns, add `inho#7094` on Discord and send me a message!

Notes: 
* At the moment, Who asks for administrator privileges in your server. You can scan the source code to see that it does nothing malicious, but if you don't trust it yet, I will be updating and cleaning up the permissions. 
* Who uses file uploads and is hosted locally, which means it might not have 100% uptime. If you're experiencing any issues, please add `inho#7094` on Discord and send me a message!
