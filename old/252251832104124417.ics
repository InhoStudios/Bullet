SUMMARY:PHIL 240A 001
LOCATION:Buchanan\, Room A202
DESCRIPTION:Phil 240 is an introduction to philosophical issues about the nature of knowledge and evidence (epistemology).  In our everyday lives\, we often claim that we know or have good reasons to believe many things  that Vancouver is near the Pacific Ocean\, that 2 + 2 = 4\, that Orcas are mammals\, that the sun will rise tomorrow\, and so on. We will begin the course by thinking about common sense principles that provide support for these claims. We will then consider the status of epistemic relativism\, the view that the kinds of reasons we give for our beliefs are only justified relative to a culture or perhaps even to an individual.\n\nNext\, we will turn our attention to philosophical skepticism. Philosophical skeptics doubt or deny that we have knowledge or justification of various sorts. Some deny that we know anything at all\, while other skeptics maintain that you dont have very much knowledge.  We will spend a lot of time thinking about arguments for and against various kinds of philosophical skepticism. How can you tell that youre not dreaming as you read this\, or that youre not currently in a Matrix?\n\nEpistemological issues arise in a number of areas of philosophy.  Well examine some of these\, including design arguments for the existence of God.  Well look at the relationship between epistemology and politics. What should you make of the fact that if you were raised in a different country or with a different family\, you might well have very different moral or political beliefs?  Well think about some epistemological issues about conspiracy theories. Are they always irrational? Finally\, well end with some epistemological questions about the nature of democracy: are there epistemic (as opposed to moral or political reasons) to make decisions in a democratic way?\n\n
